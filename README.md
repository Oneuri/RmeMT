## *Let the program read the book for you!*
##### Select and Listen!

Yes.
Today people dont have time to read large texts.
Recently I am going through many research papers because of project work. I always get stressed only by looking at the size of the paper.
And most of the time I leave it unread and start thinking that If we could have audio clips of these large research papers as we can have an audiobook.
So I started thinking and I got an amazing idea to make the program read all the text we want to read and we hear.
Then I implemented the idea, here is the product!
You guys also enjoy Listening and let the program read all the texts for you!
:)

# Here are the steps to follow
### *step 1:* 
select and Copy the whole text you want to read (that can be anything - a research paper, a book, a newspaper) 

### *Step 2:*
Now paste that copied text in a notepad file. And
 save it with the name yes.txt

### *Step 3:* 
This text file should be saved where you save your python files.
with this, you are ready to listen to the text by just running the code.
